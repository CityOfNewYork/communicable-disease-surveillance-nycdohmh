##NYC DOHMH sought to detect and minimize the risk of local, mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission. This code illustrates how for each of 14 weeks during June–September 2016, we used logistic regression to model the census tract-level presence of any ZIKV cases in the prior month, using eight covariates from static sociodemographic census data and the latest surveillance data, restricting to census tracts with any ZIKV testing in the prior month. To assess whether the model discriminated better than random between census tracts with and without recent cases, we compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for each week’s fitted model versus an intercept-only model applied to cross-validated data.
