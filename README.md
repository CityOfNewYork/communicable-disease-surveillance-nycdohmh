# NYC DOHMH - Bureau of Communicable Diseases

### Our mission is to monitor and investigate communicable disease in New York City to rapidly detect, characterize and respond to infectious disease threats in order to prevent or control ongoing transmission. To support this mission, the Reportable Disease Data, Informatics and Analysis Unit (RDDIAU) develops and maintains analyses to detect aberrations in either reporting or disease incidence that might indicate a cluster or outbreak in space or in time, or any abrupt change in disease reporting patterns.
### This site is meant to share analyses developed by RDDIAU staff that could be relevant to partners in other jurisdictions, and to further external collaboration among public health practitioners analyzing surveillance data.

### Hosted projects include all SAS code and supporting files, along with project specific `README` files that provide an inventory of project files and offer guidance for those who wish to adopt an analysis for implementation in their own jurisdiction.
