# NYC DOHMH - Bureau of Communicable Diseases

## Our mission is to monitor and investigate communicable disease in New York City in order to rapidly detect, characterize and respond to infectious disease threats in order to prevent or control ongoing transmission. To support this mission, the Reportable Disease Data, Informatics and Analysis Unit develops and maintains complex analyses to detect aberrations in either reporting or disease incidence that might indicate a cluster or outbreak in space or in time, or any abrupt change in disease reporting patterns.
