# NYC DOHMH - Bureau of Communicable Disease

### Our mission is to monitor and investigate communicable diseases in New York City (NYC) to rapidly detect, characterize, and respond to infectious disease threats in order to prevent or control ongoing transmission. To support this mission, the Reportable Disease Data, Informatics, and Analysis Unit (RDDIAU) in the Bureau of Communicable Disease of the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene develops and maintains routine analyses to detect aberrations in either reporting or disease incidence that might indicate a cluster or outbreak in space or in time, or any abrupt change in disease reporting patterns.
### This site is for sharing analyses of reportable disease data developed by RDDIAU staff that could be relevant to partners in other jurisdictions, and for promoting collaboration among public health practitioners analyzing surveillance data.

### Hosted projects include all SAS code and supporting files, along with project-specific `README` files that provide an inventory of project files and offer guidance for those who wish to adapt an analysis for their own jurisdiction.
